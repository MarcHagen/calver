CalVer is a software versioning convention based on calendar dates of
project releases, support schedules, and compatibility, instead of
arbitrary numbers. There are [many benefits][designing_a_version] to
this approach, and [multiple variations][calver_overview] to custom
fit all projects.

Calendar versioning has a long history, but CalVer itself was first
publicly released in 2016. The initial version was written by
[Mahmoud Hashemi][mahmoud], with thanks to [Stephen LaPorte][stephen],
[Mark Williams][mark], [Glyph Lefkowitz][glyph],
[Amber Brown][hawkowl], and [Hynek Schlawack][hynek].

Big thanks to [狂飙][networm] for the initial Chinese
([中文](/overview_zhcn.html)) translation.

If you have questions, comments, issues, or enhancements, please feel
free to [open an issue on the CalVer GitHub][issue].
