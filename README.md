CalVer is a project versioning convention based on calendar dates of
project releases, instead of arbitrary numbers. There are
[many benefits][designing_a_version] to this approach, and
[multiple variations][calver_overview] to custom fit all projects,
from [Ubuntu][ubuntu] to [Twisted][twisted] to [PyCharm][pycharm] to
[C][c] itself and [more][calver_users].
